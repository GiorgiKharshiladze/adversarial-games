## Adversarial Games - Lab B in CS365 - Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Class :+1:

This is a **BREAKTHRU** game written in python, & bottle framework for GUI(Graphical User Interface) in web

- This moves are based on Minimax algorithm and each player has its own playing strategy:
	White Paws are using evasive(non-offensive) while Black ones are using conqueror(offensive)

- There is some HTML, CSS & JavaScript code to render the design in your browser

- Before running this game you should check out _rules.py_ file and modify some rules like: Number of rows, columns, row_pieces, pawn color which starts the game and the strategies for each player:

-- conqueror
-- evasive
-- block
-- enhanced

- After you modify _rules.py_ you can run `python3 main.py` to see resuls in the command line

## Graphical User Interface :scream:
In the command line, run: `python3 server.py`

Go to `http://localhost:8080/`, click on **Start Game** button, See each of the **Next Move** done by the Minimax Algorithm and have fun ! :smile:
